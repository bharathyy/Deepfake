# Deepfake Detection System using LSTM Networks

Objective:
Developed a robust deepfake detection system utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to accurately identify AI-generated forgeries in video content by capturing subtle temporal patterns indicative of manipulation.

Project Description:
Deepfake technology poses a significant threat to digital media authenticity, raising concerns about misinformation, privacy infringement, and identity theft. This project addresses the challenge by proposing a novel approach using LSTM networks, known for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, to detect deepfake videos.

Responsibilities:
Feature Extraction: Analyzed video sequences frame-by-frame to extract features capturing subtle temporal patterns indicative of deepfake manipulation.
Model Development: Designed and implemented an LSTM-based classifier trained on a comprehensive dataset of authentic and deepfake videos.
Training and Evaluation: Trained the LSTM network to differentiate between genuine and manipulated content based on the temporal dynamics of facial expressions, movements, and contextual cues.
Algorithm Optimization: Optimized the model to enhance detection accuracy and robustness against evolving deepfake techniques.
Implementation: Ensured efficient and scalable implementation using Python and relevant deep learning frameworks.
Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, LSTM Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Video Processing, Feature Extraction.
